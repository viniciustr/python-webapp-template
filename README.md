# Python Webapp Template
A simple, reusable Python webapp template.

## About this project
This repository aims to provide a simple yet efficient Python web application template. This template should be a great starting point to deliver a robust web app quickly.

I thought about creating this repository right after attending QuintoAndar's 2018 Hackathon event, in which I struggled a bit to glue several boilerplates together. The end result was not what I'd like to work with, so I decided to not go through this kind of trouble in the future.

## Components
This is a no-frills Python MVC application geared towards delivering a smooth end user experience.

The main components of this app are:
* Flask
* WTForms
* Turbolinks
* SQLAlchemy

This list will be updated throughout the app's development process.
